Characteristics of Big Data
As with all big things, if we want to manage them, we need to characterize them to organize our understanding. Therefore, Big Data can be defined by one or more of three characteristics, the three Vs: high volume, high variety, and high velocity. These characteristics raise some important questions that not only help us to decipher it, but also gives an insight on how to deal with massive, disparate data at a manageable speed within a reasonable time frame so that we can get value out of it, do some real-time analysis, and provide a subsequent response quickly. Volume: Volume refers to the sheer size of the ever-exploding data of the computing world. It raises the question about the quantity of data.
Velocity: Velocity refers to the processing speed. It raises the question of at what speed the data is processed. Variety: Variety refers to the types of data. It raises the question of how disparate the data formats are. Note that we characterize Big Data into three Vs, only to simplify its basic tenets. It is quite possible that the size can be relatively small, yet too variegated and complex, or it can be relatively simple yet a huge volume of data. Therefore, in addition to these three Vs, we can easily add another, Veracity. Veracity determines the accuracy of the data in relation to the business value we want to extract. Without veracity, it is infeasible for an organization to apply its resources to analyze the pile of data. With more accuracy as to the context the data, there is a greater chance of getting valuable information. Therefore, veracity is another characteristic of Big Data. Companies leverage structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from e-mail, social media, text streams, and more. But, before analysis, it important to identify the amount and types of data in consideration that would impact business outcomes.
